- **Gain Recognition**: A strong track record of open-source contributions can enhance your professional portfolio and make you stand out to employers.

## Contributing Guide and Relevant Tools

Refer to the [official contributing guide](./contributing.md) for Ultralytics to learn more about the best practices for making contributions. If you want to contribute to the development or experiment with the latest source code, start by cloning the Ultralytics repository. After cloning, navigate to the directory and install the package in editable mode. For more details, check out the [quickstart guide](../quickstart.md).

## Finding Things to Work On

If you’re looking to contribute to the Ultralytics project, start by navigating the repository to find issues you can help with. The [Issues section](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues) is a great place to start. You can filter issues by labels, such as "bug" or "enhancement," to find tasks that match your skills and interests. Labels like "good first issue" are particularly helpful if you’re new to the project, as they indicate easier tasks.

When choosing an issue to work on, consider its impact and difficulty. Prioritize issues that will have a meaningful impact on the project or its users, but also make sure the task is within your skill set. Also, check the repository or discussions for ongoing projects or tasks that need contributors. It is a great way to get involved with more significant efforts and collaborate with other members of the community.

## How to Contribute to Open-Source Documentation

To contribute to the Ultralytics documentation, follow these steps to make sure your contributions are effective and align with the project's standards:

### Step 1: Identify the Need

Review existing content by checking for issues or discussions related to the documentation before starting to create new content to fill a gap.

### Step 2: Follow Documentation Guidelines

Write all documentation in Markdown (.md) format, ensuring proper use of headers, lists, code blocks, and other Markdown elements. Keep in mind the following tips.

**Consistent Structure and Style**:

- Start each document with an introduction or summary.
- Use H1 (`#`) for titles, and H2 (`##`), H3 (`###`), etc., for subheadings.
- Include a metadata block at the top with `description`, `keywords`, and `comments`.
- Keep language clear and accessible, avoiding unnecessary jargon.

**Formatting**:

- Use sentence case for all headings.
- Use bullet points for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
- Use descriptive text for hyperlinks and relative paths for internal links.
- Include relevant images with alt text that enhance the understanding of the content.
- If you need clarification on any formatting, check other docs to see the style of formatting used.

**Automatically Generated FAQs**: FAQs are automatically generated based on the content, so there's no need to add them manually. Focus on clear and detailed sections that will help generate useful FAQs.

### Step 3: Build the Docs Locally

After making your changes, you can build the documentation locally to preview how it will look. First, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
```

Then, you can navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd ultralytics
```

Next, install dependencies. For detailed instructions and best practices related to the installation process, check our [YOLOv8 Installation guide](../quickstart.md). While installing the required packages for YOLOv8, if you encounter any difficulties, consult our [Common Issues guide](../guides/yolo-common-issues.md) for solutions and tips.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Finally, serve the documentation locally. You can check that everything displays correctly before submitting your changes. You can view the locally built docs by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

```bash
mkdocs serve -f mkdocs.yml
```

### Step 4: Submitting Contributions

Before submitting your changes, double-check that your documentation is clear, accurate, and follows these guidelines. Then, you can submit a pull request with a clear and descriptive message outlining the improvements made.

## How to Review Pull Requests (PRs)

Reviewing Pull Requests (PRs) is a vital part of keeping an open-source project healthy. Good PR reviews help check that new contributions meet the project’s standards and don’t introduce bugs or issues. As a reviewer, you can help maintain quality, guide contributors, and foster collaboration.

### Tips for Reviewing PRs

When you're reviewing a PR, here are some things to keep in mind:

- **Check for Unit Tests**: Make sure any new features or changes come with appropriate unit tests. These tests help confirm that the new code works as expected and doesn’t break anything else. If tests are missing, suggest adding them.
- **Ensure Documentation is Updated**: Check that the documentation reflects any changes or additions. This includes updating usage examples, API references, and anything else that’s relevant. If something’s unclear or missing, ask the author to update it.
- **Verify All CI Tests are Passing**: Before you approve a PR, make sure all Continuous Integration (CI) tests are passing. These tests automatically check for issues like code formatting errors and failed unit tests. If any tests are failing, work with the author to fix them.

### Evaluating Feature Changes and Additions

When a PR adds new features or changes existing ones, use these guidelines to assess the contribution:

- **Performance Checks**: Consider the performance impact of the new feature or change. It shouldn’t slow things down, and it should work efficiently. If needed, ask the author for performance benchmarks or additional testing.
- **Rationale and Thorough Testing**: Understand why the changes were made. The author should clearly explain the purpose and benefits. Also, review how thoroughly the changes were tested, both with automated tests and any manual testing.

### Providing Constructive Feedback

When giving feedback on a PR, aim to be helpful and supportive:

- **Be Specific and Clear**: Point out any issues or concerns clearly and provide specific examples or suggestions. Your feedback can help the author make the necessary changes.
- **Encourage Best Practices**: Guide the author to follow best practices for coding, testing, and documentation. Encourage them to stick to the project’s style guidelines and think about the broader impact of their changes.
- **Acknowledge Effort**: Always recognize the effort the author put into the PR. Positive feedback helps maintain a friendly and collaborative atmosphere in the open-source community.

## Coding Tips

When contributing to the Ultralytics project, keep these coding best practices in mind:

- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Reuse existing code wherever possible and minimize the introduction of additional arguments unless necessary.
- **Make Smaller, Focused Changes**: Focus on smaller, more targeted changes rather than large, sweeping modifications. It makes your contributions easier to review and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Simplify or Remove Code**: Always look for opportunities to simplify code or remove unnecessary parts, rather than adding complexity.
- **Write Effective Docstrings**: Clearly explain what your code does in docstrings, and link to relevant documentation or resources to provide additional context.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Dependencies**: Refrain from adding dependencies unless they are absolutely needed, as they can complicate the codebase.
- **Consider Maintainability**: Think about the long-term maintainability of the codebase with every change you make.
- **Run Tests Using Pytest**: Before submitting your code, run tests on your changes using `pytest` to ensure everything works as expected.
- **Use Ruff Formatter**: Maintain consistent code formatting and check for errors using the Ruff formatter.

### Using Ruff Formatter

By integrating Ruff into your workflow, you can ensure that your contributions are clean, efficient, and easy to maintain. Ruff is both a formatter and a linter that can provide comprehensive checks and corrections for your code.

As a formatter, it quickly checks and re-formats your code to have stylistic consistency without changing how the code runs. As a linter, it goes further by detecting potential logical bugs and stylistic inconsistencies and often suggests fixes. For more detailed instructions and tutorials on using Ruff, visit the [Ruff GitHub repository](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

## Key Takeaways
